# Harry-Potter-Text-Analytics

Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling is a well-known and well-loved series throughout the world. However, some individuals may find one book more interesting than another. This project seeks to quantify variation in sentiment throughout the series using valence and arousal scores, and examines the relationship of sentiment to character presence over time. Results are conveyed through an interactive dashboard created using Plotly and Dash.
